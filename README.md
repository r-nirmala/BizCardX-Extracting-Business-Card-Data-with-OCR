## BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR
  BizCardX-Extracting Business Card Data with OCR Bizcard Extraction is a Python application built with Streamlit, EasyOCR and MySQL database. By leveraging the power of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) provided by EasyOCR, this application extracts information from business cards and store it in a MySQL database for further analysis. It also gives users access to read, update and remove data through a streamlined user interface.

### REQUIRED LIBRARIES:
*Easyocr

*Streamlit

*PIL

*Numpy

*Pandas

*Mysql.connector

*RegEx or Regular Expression(re)

### Approach:

--->Use Streamlit to create a basic and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and retrieving its information.

--->Use easyOCR to extract the required information from the business card image. Once the information has been extracted, display it in the Streamlit GUI in a well-organised and structured manner.

--->In order to maintain the extracted information alongside the submitted business card image, use a database management system such as MySQL.

--->Use SQL queries to obtain data from the database. Create an easy-to-use user interface for the application so that data may be updated and deleted.
